In this github repo, I implemented firebase authentication to login a user to the platform. Please sign up first and foremost with your email and password. Wait for a few moments, and then go ahead and use the same credentials you used for your email and password to sign in:smile:

Once a user has signed in, we can see their details on the firebase backend from where we can keep track of the registered users.

# Business Value ðŸ’¸

My goal with this platform is to build a meme-repository, from where users on the internet can build and upload memes that they find interesting, funny, and relevant.
The user would save the meme with a keyword, and the platform would implement an easy to use, interactive search bar. From this search bar, any user can search for 
a meme they like a retrieve it at the touch of a button. Long term, my goal is to be able to implement Artificial Intellegence on this platform with libraries such as open cv,
or even web-crawlers that can retrieve popular memes on the internet and just have one big, clean repository for memes. This is my long term goal, which I intend to do in the 
months to come with PLP.
